                        Vilen demonstrated their experience in Mobile development at FAIRTIQ on a daily basis, working on the company's core projects. They demonstrated good performance in terms of quality and quantity even under constant workload. We knew them as a reliable and highly independent contributor, who performed their tasks with high care and accuracy. Their actions were always thought-out, they displayed good initiative and they were very efficient as well as highly versatile and willing to learn. Their strong technical skills and problem solving abilities, along with their reaction to critical issues, lead to impactful results.
                        <br/><br/>
                        Their ability to work both on iOS and Android made them a great asset, as they were able to compare implementation between both, or work on the platform that needed them the most at each time. Vilen was always focused on delivering what the user needs, and thought about edge cases and shortcomings of a concrete feature.
                        <br/><br/>
                        Vilen identified themselves well with our company, its values and with their work. We have come to know them as a greatly dedicated and loyal partner who was ready to take on responsibility. Vilen displayed high professionalism and excellent behaviour towards all stakeholders. They are a superb team player and regularly offered to help and assist colleagues.
                        <br/><br/>
                        Vilen decided to stop their collaboration with our company by 29.12.2022 to pursue other challenges. They are free of any obligation but the provisions concerning confidentiality and non-competition as stipulated in the employment contract. We thank Vilen for their great commitment and contribution to our company as well as for their superb performance and the always constructive and trusting collaboration.

                        It is with great pleasure that I am writing this letter of recommendation for Vilen Melkumyan as an app
                        developer. I have worked and collaborated with Vilen for the past 7 years on our Android-based QBOT
                        V3 app. Vilen was able to come into the project after the initial app was started by other, less qualified
                        programmers. Vilen was able to clean up sloppy code and implement new features for our app while
                        simultaneously lowering our user crash analytics. Ours is a complicated app that interfaces with 2D
                        motion control hardware over a Bluetooth serial connection.
                        <br/><br/>
                        Using Vilen’s strengths in mathematics, analytical geometry, and programming we were able to add
                        features for vector pattern manipulation, scaling, rotation, skewing, and precision fitting to physical
                        boundaries that the user selects in the real world. This is no small task as it is all done with gesture
                        control and the patterns themselves are continuous lines, not bitmap images.
                        <br/><br/>
                        Most importantly, Vilen is able to take instructions or ideas that are not fully developed and bring them
                        to life. He knows what questions to ask and can communicate potential issues that may come up early
                        in the process. This has been the key to the success of our app and is a recipe for success when creating
                        new apps as well.
                        <br/><br/>
                        Vilen’s technical strengths and communication skills make him a much sought after addition to any
                        team. Any employer would be lucky to have him.

                        Working with Vilen Melkumyan for almost a year has been a true pleasure.
                        He was the sole lead on all Android development, which included educating me about Google Play environment and best practices.
                        Due to his work, we launched a high quality, sophisticated Android app with a variety of custom features,
                        3rd party integrations, and constantly changing product definitions.
                        He responded with enthusiasm and a good quality work ethic.
                        He initiated projects to improve quality and design animations, and especially to my liking, app performance.
                        He played a critical role in the company for his ability to step outside his defined role and engage with UX,
                        API architecture, code quality, cost & schedule, and company objectives.
                        His commitment to the project and the company was also invaluable as we are a small startup
                        that need to move quickly with minimal resources. I got lucky to find someone of his caliber and
                        I would not hesitate to work with Vilen Melkumyan again.

                        We are very, very glad that we found Vilen to work on our Android project for us.
                        The selection of a remote contractor is critical to project success, however,
                        it was a relief to work with Vilen who had clear communication, realistic, easy-to-manage expectations,
                        flexible work hours, and a nice attitude. This was the first exposure of my company with Android development
                        and Vilen has given us enough of a jump-start to feel confident to release our Android app frequently and easily,
                        and also hire full-time employees to continue the work that Vilen handed off.
                        Basically, the ideal role of a contractor - to deliver immediate value for a client so that
                        they can build off that value going forward. I would be happy to work with Vilen in the future.
                        He learned a lot of new things pretty quickly on our project, and we really liked that attitude,
                        it helped two-way collaboration between Vilen and my team in Canada.
                        Hope to do more business with Vilen in the future.

                        This is a letter of recommendation for Vilen Melkumyan. Vilen has worked for Scopic Software,
                        of which I am the owner, since February 2010. Vilen works remotely from his home in Yerevan Armenia.
                        Vilen has mentioned his desire to continue his academic studies several times.
                        I am very happy that he is taking steps to do this. His action however is not a surprise as
                        Vilen is very ambitious and has definite goals that he aspires to.
                        <br/>
                        Vilen has many positive attributes. What stands out most is his hard work and dedication.
                        There are few employees in the company that works harder than Vilen.
                        He is always a pleasure to work with. His colleagues find him to be eager, congenial and communicative.
                        <br/>
                        He has worked on some very challenging projects for us. He is a core member for a large online
                        greeting card creation application we have developed and continue to enhance.
                        He also worked on several other significant web applications both by himself and as a member of a team. H
                        e has become a very good Flex developer in the time he has been with us.
                        He is taking more and more technical responsibility with each new project.
                        <br/>
                        I have not witnessed Vilen in an academic setting, however I have worked with literally
                        hundreds of engineers in my 25 years of industry experience and spotting talent is my forte.
                        Vilen is talented and will do well academically. I believe he can do original work.
                        <br/>
                        I highly recommend Vilen Melkumyan both as a student and a person.
